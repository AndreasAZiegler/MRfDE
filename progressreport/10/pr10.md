# Summary

I continued working on the 2D proof-of-concept. I have now a version which handles loop-closures (correcting the polygon, merging the overlapping parts of the polygon and merging the active areas). I also got FLaME [@Greene2017] running in my ROS environment and read the suggested papers [@Ryde2015] and [@DBLP:journals/corr/RydeD17], which seem to be not so relevant for our use case.

# Next steps
* Describing the algorithm(s) used for the current 2D proof-of-concept
* Try some other maps (e.g. with small obstacles)
* Going 3D
