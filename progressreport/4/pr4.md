# Summary

Since the last meeting, I implemented a simulation environment for a proof of concept and started with the calculation of a polygon out of a depth measurement. After the meeting with Matthias Th√∂ny and Claudio Mura there are still a lot of open question but Claudio Mura could point us to some resource which hopefully clear things up.

# New ideas

# Open questions

* What of the 2D approach will also work in 3D?
* Should I start with an approach or rather first learn more about meshes (I tend to the second choise)?

# Next steps

* Get a clear view about mesh-based approaches (Probably with the resources which Claudio Mura recommended)
* Finish polygon calculation (with ray intersection)
* Work on the proof of concept (Toy example)
