# Summary

I mainly worked on the report and improved the demo. I also started working on the presentation.

# New ideas
* Structure of the presentation:
  * I would suggest to mainly follow the structure of the report with the exception of the motivation / problem statement in the beginning, where I explain the problem with drift in the trajectory and the resulting maps already a first time.
* Proof for complete exploration, a first idea:
  * We perceive unknown space as long as there are frontiers because frontiers are the boundary between free known and unknown space. If no frontiers are left, there is no unknown space left to explore. If there is unknown space that is accessible, it is adjacent to known free space otherwise it would not be accessible. The boundary between known free and unknown space defines frontiers and if there are frontiers, exploration is not finished which is a contradiction.

# Open questions
* I think we should adapt the title of my thesis. Maybe we can do some brainstorming in the next meeting.
* Would it be possible that I do the trial presentation in the beginning or middle of next week (Tuesday or Wednesday)?
