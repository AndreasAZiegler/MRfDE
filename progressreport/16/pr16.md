# Summary

Since last time, I implemented the handling of upended polygons and the modification of mesh points which lie on a polygon line segment. I also improved the accessibility check for frontier points. I read [@Gonzalez-Banos2002] again, to become more aware of the differences between their and our approach. I also worked on the description of the approach.

<!--# New ideas-->

# Open questions
* Ordering of the description of the approach (Some ideas depend on each other, e.g. the concept of the active area is used to merge polygons)
* How to describe the adaptation of the rapid exploration approach to the polygon based representation (Also part of the methodology?)

# Next steps
* Finish description of the approach
* Write related work section

# Bibliography
