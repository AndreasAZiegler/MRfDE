abstract = {Voronoi graphs and their hierarchical extensions have become a widely used tool for deriving abstract spatial representations from environmental data. They are currently being studied and applied in several subfields of computer science such as AI and robotics, computational geometry, and geoinformatics. This book investigates the application of hierarchical Voronoi graphs for the internal spatial memory of a mobile robot, focusing on the robot mapping problem of deriving the correct representation from uncertain data. The author develops and illustrates several fundamental techniques for constructing hierarchical Voronoi graph representations, employing a broad set of methods ranging from spatial abstraction approaches to graph matching, search, and qualitative spatial reasoning. It is further shown how the developed tools can be combined to form an overall robot mapping system. The presented material is intended for researchers, students, and practitioners with backgrounds in robotics, AI, or related fields who are engaged with spatial representations and reasoning. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2010.

abstract = {This paper describes Atlas, a hybrid metrical/topological approach to SLAM that achieves efficient mapping of large-scale environments. The representation is a graph of coordinate frames, with each vertex in the graph representing a local frame, and each edge representing the transformation between adjacent frames. In each frame, we build a map that captures the local environment and the current robot pose along with the uncertainties of each. Each map's uncertainties are modeled with respect to its own frame. Probabilities of entities with respect to arbitrary frames are generated by following a path formed by the edges between adjacent frames, computed via Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm. Loop closing is achieved via an efficient map matching algorithm. We demonstrate the technique running in real-time in a large indoor structured environment (2.2 km path length) with multiple nested loops using laser or ultrasonic ranging sensors.},

abstract = {This paper presents a new map specifically designed for robots operating in large environments and possibly in higher dimensions. We call this map the hierarchical atlas because it is a multilevel and multiresolution representation. For this paper, the hierarchical atlas has two levels: at the highest level there is a topological map that organizes the free space into submaps at the lower level. The lower-level submaps are simply a collection of features. The hierarchical atlas allows us to perform calculations and run estimation techniques, such as Kalman filtering, in local areas without having to correlate and associate data for the entire map. This provides a means to explore and map large environments in the presence of uncertainty with a process named hierarchical simultaneous localization and mapping. As well as organizing information of the free space, the map also induces well-defined sensor-based control laws and a provably complete policy to explore unknown regions. The resulting map is also useful for other tasks such as navigation, obstacle avoidance, and global localization. Experimental results are presented showing successful map building and subsequent use of the map in large-scale spaces.},
annote = {This paper outlines the uses of the hierarchical atlas as a toool to enable navigation, exploration, mapping, and global localiyation for large-scale environments in the presence of uncertainty.
The key feature of this hierarchical approach is the meaningful embedding of submaps into the free space. Since the RGVG has a concrete basis in the free space, we are able to tie our edge maps to the environment. Through the RGVG, als a delibrate and complete exploration strategy is acquired.
The topological architecture induces a natural hierarchy of symbols and connection among them. The symbols are the nodes of the RGVG, and the connections ar the edges. The connections (edges) themselves can be further discretized into a collection of symbols and connection e.g. imgae features.},

abstract = {This paper presents a new method for simultaneous localization and$\backslash$nmapping that exploits the topology of the robot's free space to localize$\backslash$nthe robot on a partially constructed map.

annote = {This paper formulates a new approach to SLAM of unknown regions using a topological map annotated with some geometric features. The specific map used in this work is the GVG. Construction the GVG is akin to provably complete exploration because once the robot knows the GVG it can plan a path between any two location.
The main contribution is using a topology to localize a robot while mapping an unknows space. The nodes of the GVG are used as landmarks. These landmarks are topologically meaningful events that the robot can determine on-line.
The presented algorithm places more emphasis on how features relate to one another than on the actual features themselves, enabling to store a concise data record of each individual feature and bypass the need to make detailed data comparisons among features.},

abstract = {The generalized Voronoi graph (GVG) is a topological representation of an environment that can be incrementally constructed with a mobile robot using sensor-based control. However, because of sensor range limitations, the GVG control law will fail when the robot moves into a large open area. This paper discusses an extended GVG approach to topological navigation and mapping: the saturated generalized Voronoi graph (S-GVG), for which the robot employs an additional wall-following behavior to navigate along obstacles at the range limit of the sensor. In this paper, we build upon previous work related to the S-GVG and provide two important contributions: 1) a rigorous discussion of the control laws and algorithm modifications that are necessary for incremental construction of the S-GVG with a mobile robot, and 2) a method for incorporating the S-GVG into a novel multi-hypothesis SLAM algorithm for loop-closing and localization. Experiments with a wheeled mobile robot in an office-like environment validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},
