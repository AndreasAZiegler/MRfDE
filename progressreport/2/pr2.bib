abstract = {In this paper we consider the problem of exploring an unknown environment by a team of robots. As in single-robot exploration the goal is to minimize the overall exploration time. The key problem to be solved in the context of multiple robots is to choose appropriate target points for the individual robots so that they simultaneously explore different regions of the environment. We present an approach for the coordination of multiple robots which, in contrast to previous approaches, simultaneously takes into account the cost of reaching a target point and its utility. The utility of a target point is given by the size of the unexplored area that a robot can cover with its sensors upon reaching that location. Whenever a target point is assigned to a specific robot, the utility of the unexplored area visible from this target position is reduced for the other robots. This way, a team of multiple robots assigns different target points to the individual robots. The technique has been implemented and tested extensively in real-world experiments and simulation runs. The results given in this paper demonstrate that our coordination technique significantly reduces the exploration time compared to previous approaches.},
annote = {A technique for coordinating a team of robots while they are exploring their environment is presented. The key ideo of this technique is to simultaneoulsy take into account the cost of reaching a so far unecplored location and its utility. The utility of a target location depends on the probability that this location is visible from target locations assigned to other robots. The algorithm always assigns the target location to a robot which has the best trade-off betwwen utility and costs. It explicit assigns different target locations to the robots.

A central module receives the local maps and combines them into a single, global map which then is broadcasted to all robots.
The system relies on the two assumptions:
1. The robots must begin their operation in nearby locations, so that their range scans show substantial overlap.
2. The software must be told the approximate relative initial pose of the robots.},

abstract="Exploring an unknown environment with multiple robots requires an efficient coordination method to minimize the total duration. A standard method to discover new areas is to assign frontiers (boundaries between unexplored and explored accessible areas) to robots. In this context, the frontier allocation method is paramount. This paper introduces a decentralized and computationally efficient frontier allocation method favoring a well balanced spatial distribution of robots in the environment. For this purpose, each robot evaluates its relative rank among the other robots in term of travel distance to each frontier. Accordingly, robots are allocated to the frontier for which it has the lowest rank. To evaluate this criteria, a wavefront propagation is computed from each frontier giving an interesting alternative to path planning from robot to frontiers. Comparisons with existing approaches in computerized simulation and on real robots demonstrated the validity and efficiency of our algorithm.",

The representation is a graph of coordinate frames, with each vertex in the graph representing a local frame, and each edge representing the transformation between adjacent frames. In each frame, we build a map that captures the local environment and the current robot pose along with the uncertainties of each. Each map's uncertainties are modeled with respect to its own frame. Probabilities of entities with respect to arbitrary frames are generated by following a path formed by the edges between adjacent frames, computed via Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm. Loop closing is achieved via an efficient map matching algorithm. We demonstrate the technique running in real-time in a large indoor structured environment (2.2 km path length) with multiple nested loops using laser or ultrasonic ranging sensors.},

abstract = {Most successful works in simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) aim to build a metric map under a probabilistic viewpoint employing Bayesian filtering techniques. This work introduces a new hybrid metric-topological approach, where the aim is to reconstruct the path of the robot in a hybrid continuous-discrete state space which naturally combines metric and topological maps. Our fundamental contributions are: (i) the estimation of the topological path, an improvement similar to that of Rao-Blackwellized particle filters (RBPF) and FastSLAM in the field of metric map building; and (ii) the application of grounded methods to the abstraction of topology (including loop closure) from raw sensor readings. It is remarkable that our approach could be still represented as a Bayesian inference problem, becoming an extension of purely metric SLAM. Besides providing the formal definitions and the basics for our approach, we also describe a practical implementation aimed to real-time operation. Promising experimental results mapping large environments with multiple nested loops ({\~{}}30.000 m2, {\~{}}2Km robot path) validate our work.},

abstract = {With society and industry pushing for robot-assisted systems to automate cumbersome tasks, such as inspection and maintenance, a vast amount of research effort has been dedicated to relevant technologies. Right at the forefront are small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) equipped with onboard cameras, recently demonstrating that vision-based autonomous flights without reliance on GPS are possible, sparking great interest in a plethora of areas. Current solutions, however, still lack in portability and generality struggling to perform outside the controlled laboratory environment, with onboard robotic perception constituting the biggest impediment. Driven by the need for real-time denser scene estimation, in this work we present a dramatically cheap approach enabling estimation of the immediate surroundings of a UAV using the inertial and visual cues from a single onboard camera. Instead of following the recent trend towards dense scene reconstruction, we trade detail of reconstruction for efficiency of estimation, albeit without compromising accuracy. We also present ETHZ CAB building dataset for aerial inspection. We present results against scene ground truth obtained by a millimetre-precise laser scanner.},

@article{Gonzalez-Banos2002,
abstract = {In this paper, we investigate safe and efficient map-building strategies for a mobile robot with imperfect control and sensing. In the implementation, a robot equipped with a range sensor builds a polygonal map (layout) of a previously unknown indoor environment. The robot explores the environment and builds the map concurrently by patching together the local models acquired by the sensor into a global map. A well-studied and related problem is the simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) problem, where the goal is to integrate the information collected during navigation into the most accurate map possible. However, SLAM does not address the sensor-placement portion of the map-building task. That is, given the map built so far, where should the robot go next? This is the main question addressed in this paper. Concretely, an algorithm is proposed to guide the robot through a series of 'good' positions, where 'good' refers to the expected amount and quality of the information that will be revealed at each new location. This is similar to the next-best-view (NBV) problem studied in computer vision and graphics. However, in mobile robotics the problem is complicated by several issues, two of which are particularly crucial. One is to achieve safe navigation despite an incomplete knowledge of the environment and sensor limitations (e.g., in range and incidence). The other issue is the need to ensure sufficient overlap between each new local model and the current map, in order to allow registration of successive views under positioning uncertainties inherent to mobile robots. To address both issues in a coherent framework, in this paper we introduce the concept of a safe region, defined as the largest region that is guaranteed to be free of obstacles given the sensor readings made so far. The construction of a safe region takes sensor limitations into account. In this paper we also describe an NBV algorithm that uses the safe-region concept to select the next robot position at each step. The new position is chosen within the safe region in order to maximize the expected gain of information under the constraint that the local model at this new position must have a minimal overlap with the current global map. In the future, NBV and SLAM algorithms should reinforce each other. While a SLAM algorithm builds a map by making the best use of the available sensory data, an NBV algorithm, such as that proposed here, guides the navigation of the robot through positions selected to provide the best sensory inputs.},

abstract = {This paper is on simultaneous exploration and topological map building in completely unknown environments. We propose an approach that consists of a continuous loop of local decision-making (where potential search directions are added to the current node) and global decision-making (where the robot moves along one of these directions and adds possibly a new node to the map ) using the previously proposed bubble space representation. As the robot switches between the two in a continual manner, it creates a coarse graph representation of the environment. There is a node for every explored location with a set of associated edges that either indicate potential search directions or connect to the other explored locations. The so-far constructed topological map contains all the required information in regards to deciding where to move with compar- atively low memory requirements. Experimental results with an extensive real data set demonstrate that large terrains can be explored and mapped efficiently using this approach.},
