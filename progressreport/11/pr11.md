# Summary

I worked on additional examples for the 2D proof of concept. While playing with different maps and trajectories, I found and fixed several bugs. From the feedback I got after the presentation on Tuesday, it seems we following a promising approach.

<!--# New ideas-->

<!--# Open questions-->

# Next steps
* Try some other maps (e.g. with small obstacles)
* Implementing pose graph
* Implementing rapid exploration
