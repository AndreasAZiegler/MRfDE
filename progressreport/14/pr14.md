# Summary

I worked on the adaptation of the rapid exploration approach for the mesh based frontier representation. I added an option to turn off the insertion of the intersection point which result in a smoother mesh (See \autoref{fig:noisy}, \autoref{fig:noisy-zoom} for an example with the intersection points inserted). I also improved the accessibility check of the rapid exploration. A few improvements e.g. handling of not accessible frontier points are still on the to do list and there are also some open questions.

# New ideas
* Preventing false polygon merges by comparing the polygon areas

# Open questions
* How to better deal with self intersections e.g. \autoref{fig:before}, \autoref{fig:after}

# Next steps
* Handling of not accessible frontiers
* Evaluate direct way to frontier / pose graph points (Skipping intermediate way points)
* Improving polygon merging considering the area of the polygons
