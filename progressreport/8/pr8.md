# Summary

Since the last meeting, I worked on our own polygon merge approach as the existing polygon intersection libraries do not allow to handle different types of line segments (frontiers and obstacles in our case) and adapting a library does not seem straight-forward.

I continued a bit to get FLaME [@Greene2017] running but there are still some library dependency issues.
