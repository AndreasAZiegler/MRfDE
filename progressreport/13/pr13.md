# Summary

Since last time, I mainly worked on the rapid exploration approach for the 2D proof of concept. It works partially but I'm still facing some problems, e.g. special intersections which the polygon merging can't handle well.

# Open questions
I have some questions regarding the rapid exploration approach for our map representation. I think it is best if we discuss these during our meeting tomorrow.

# Next steps
* Finish rapid exploration
