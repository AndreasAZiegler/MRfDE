# Summary

I implemented the active area grow / searching entry, exit intersection mechanism which reduces the number of merge failures by a large amount. There are still some cases, when the merge fails, e.g. when a polygon point "touches" a line segment of the frustum (in this case the polygon enters and exits the frustum in the same point) as shown in \autoref{fig:mergefail1} and \autoref{fig:mergefail2}.

As approaching a frontier point from the corresponding pose graph point is sometimes impossible as the path is too close to an obstacle, I implemented an alternative method, which approaches the frontier point via a point which lays on the normal of the frontier line.

The correction of the polygon during loop closure can lead to polygons with self intersections. Due to this self intersections, some polygons have wrong direction which leads to merge failures (e.g. \autoref{fig:selfintersection}). To handle this cases, I improved the removal of self intersections during loop closure. Polygons with a self intersection are now split into two polygons and the direction is corrected. I will add a similar approach to the normal polygon merge as well, as the same problem can occur there too.

With these improvements, the polygon merging behaves now much more stable.
