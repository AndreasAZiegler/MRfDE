# Summary

I continued working on the 2D proof-of-concept. Polygon-merging, obstacle and frontier lines and the active area approach seem to work now. I will continue with the handling of loop closures and the resulting polygon deformation.

<!--# New ideas-->

<!--# Open questions-->

# Next steps

* Polygon deformation due to loop-closure in 2D proof-of-concept
* Get FLaME running
