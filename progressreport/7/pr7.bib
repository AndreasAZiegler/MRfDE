abstract = {Figure 1: Fast Lightweight Mesh Estimation: FLaME generates 3D mesh reconstructions from monocular images in real-time onboard computationally constrained platforms. The key to the approach is a graph-based variational optimization framework that allows for the mesh to be efficiently smoothed and refined. The top row of images (from left to right) show the meshes computed onboard a small autonomous robot flying at 3.5 meters-per-second as it avoids a tree. The bottom row shows the current frame (left), the collision-free plan in pink (middle), and the dense depthmap generated from the mesh (right) for each timestep along the approach. Abstract We propose a lightweight method for dense online monocular depth estimation capable of reconstructing 3D meshes on computationally constrained platforms. Our main contribution is to pose the reconstruction problem as a non-local variational optimization over a time-varying De-launay graph of the scene geometry, which allows for an efficient, keyframeless approach to depth estimation. The graph can be tuned to favor reconstruction quality or speed and is continuously smoothed and augmented as the camera explores the scene. Unlike keyframe-based approaches, the optimized surface is always available at the current pose, which is necessary for low-latency obstacle avoidance. FLaME (Fast Lightweight Mesh Estimation) can gener-ate mesh reconstructions at upwards of 230 Hz using less than one Intel i7 CPU core, which enables operation on size, weight, and power-constrained platforms. We present results from both benchmark datasets and experiments run-ning FLaME in-the-loop onboard a small flying quadrotor.},
annote = {This paper presents a novel dense monocular depth estimation algorithm capable of reconstructing geometric meshes on computationally constrained platforms. FLaME refrmulates the reconstruciton problem as a variational smoothing problem over a time-varying Delaunay graph, which allows both for efficient, incremental smoothing of noisy depth estimates and low-latency mesh estimation.
The mesh is interpreted as a graph over which a convec optimization problem is set to perform the smoothing.},
